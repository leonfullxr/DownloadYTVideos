# YouTube videos to mp3/mp4 format
A Python script that given a youtube playlist link or a video link, it will download it in a given user format (mp3/mp4).

## TODO:
I would like to create an app to edit the songs names, maybe delete any songs from the playlist to not download it, etc.

I will propably use electron, work is still in progress.
