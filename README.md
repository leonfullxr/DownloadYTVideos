# YTPlaylistToMP4
A Python script that given a youtube playlist link, it will download all the youtube videos in that playlist with an mp4 format

## TODO:
I would like to create an app to edit the songs names, maybe delete any songs from the playlist to not download it, etc.

I will propably use electron, work is still in progress.
